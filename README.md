Python in high school physics course. For teachers, children and parents who enjoy Python programming. We present an 
animation that demonstrates(qualitatively) the refraction of the light passing through a lens (glasses), which corrects 
visual acuity. The animation shows the position of the beam focused in the eye depending on the lens thickness. 
The program is written with Pygame library. This simulation is important and informative for schoolkids who learn coding, 
physics and mathematics. When developing a program, students also master better school physics and mathematics. Files for 
modeling this scenario can be downloaded for free at:
